       <h1>Osun River, Osun State</h1>

   <div id="primary-content">
       <p>Osun River is one of the most peaceful and serene attractions of Osun State Nigeria.
           It gave me much pleasure to be at the river. People came from far and near to experience
           the serene presence of Osun. This river is believed to have mystical power to aid women 
           who had problems with child-bearing to bear kids and to give impotent men power to have 
           kids.
